# Digital Modulation by Monte Carlo's Algorithm - Maximum Spectral Density within Probability Threshold.

This project is the resolution of the Final Exam of the discipline of EET-50: Communication Systems, of the
Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA), in Brazil.

I published this to hopefully help someone with the same curriculum required.

# Q1 - SER comparison in Experimental Digital Modulation and its Theoretical Analog

# Q2 - Bit Error Rate comparison for QAM modulation - Gray vs Natural Mapping

# Q3 - Maximizing Spectral Density with threshold of Maximum Probability of Error

# Q4 - Maximizing Spectral Density with threshold of Maximum Probability of Error
